## How to Deploy on GitHub Pages (Free Hosting)

1.  **Create a New GitHub Repository:**
    * Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in (or sign up).
    * Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner and select "New repository."
    * Name your repository **`linear-regression`** (or anything you prefer, but `linear-regression` is a good, descriptive name).
    * Make sure it's **Public**.
    * Do **NOT** initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license for now.
    * Click "Create repository."

2.  **Upload Your Files:**
    * On the next page, you'll see options to "quick setup." Choose the "upload an existing file" option.
    * Drag and drop your `index.html` and `style.css` files into the upload area.
    * Add a commit message (e.g., "Initial website commit").
    * Click "Commit changes."

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    * Once your files are uploaded, go to the **"Settings"** tab of your repository.
    * In the left sidebar, click on **"Pages"**.
    * Under "Build and deployment," ensure "Deploy from a branch" is selected.
    * Under "Branch," select `main` (or `master` if that's what your repository created) and choose `/ (root)`.
    * Click **"Save"**.

4.  **Access Your Website:**
    * After a few moments (it might take 1-5 minutes for GitHub to build and deploy), refresh the "Pages" settings page.
    * You will see a message like "Your site is live at `https://yourusername.github.io/linear-regression/`".
    * Click on that URL to view your live website!

**Tip:** If you need to make changes, simply edit the `index.html` or `style.css` files directly on GitHub (by navigating to the file and clicking the edit icon) or by cloning the repository, making changes locally, and then pushing them back. GitHub Pages will automatically redeploy.
